<h3>John 8:31-59 New International Version (NIV)</span></h3><br>
<h4>Dispute Over Whose Children Jesus’ Opponents Are</h4>
<p><sup>31&nbsp;</sup>To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, “If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples.
<sup>32&nbsp;</sup>Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”</p>
<p><sup>33&nbsp;</sup>They answered him, “We are Abraham’s descendants and have never been slaves of anyone. How can you say that we shall be set free?”</p>
<p><sup>34&nbsp;</sup>Jesus replied, “Very truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.
<sup>35&nbsp;</sup>Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever.
<sup>36&nbsp;</sup>So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.
<sup>37&nbsp;</sup>I know that you are Abraham’s descendants. Yet you are looking for a way to kill me, because you have no room for my word.
<sup>38&nbsp;</sup>I am telling you what I have seen in the Father’s presence, and you are doing what you have heard from your father.</p>
<p><sup>39&nbsp;</sup>“Abraham is our father,” they answered.</p>
<p>“If you were Abraham’s children,” said Jesus, “then you would do what Abraham did.
<sup>40&nbsp;</sup>As it is, you are looking for a way to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do such things.
<sup>41&nbsp;</sup>You are doing the works of your own father.”</p>
<p>“We are not illegitimate children,” they protested. “The only Father we have is God himself.”</p>
<p><sup>42&nbsp;</sup>Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love me, for I have come here from God. I have not come on my own; God sent me.
<sup>43&nbsp;</sup>Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say.
<sup>44&nbsp;</sup>You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies. 
<sup>45&nbsp;</sup>Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me!
<sup>46&nbsp;</sup>Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don’t you believe me?
<sup>47&nbsp;</sup>Whoever belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God.”</p>
<h4>Jesus’ Claims About Himself</h4>
<p><sup>48&nbsp;</sup>The Jews answered him, “Aren’t we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and demon-possessed?”</p>
<p><sup>49&nbsp;</sup>“I am not possessed by a demon,” said Jesus, “but I honor my Father and you dishonor me.
<sup>50&nbsp;</sup>I am not seeking glory for myself; but there is one who seeks it, and he is the judge.
<sup>51&nbsp;</sup>Very truly I tell you, whoever obeys my word will never see death.”</p>
<p><sup>52&nbsp;</sup>At this they exclaimed, “Now we know that you are demon-possessed! Abraham died and so did the prophets, yet you say that whoever obeys your word will never taste death. 
<sup>53&nbsp;</sup>Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?”</span></p>
<p><sup>54&nbsp;</sup>Jesus replied, “If I glorify myself, my glory means nothing. My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me.
<sup>55&nbsp;</sup>Though you do not know him, I know him. If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and obey his word.
<sup>56&nbsp;</sup>Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad.”</p>
<p><sup>57&nbsp;</sup>“You are not yet fifty years old,” they said to him, “and you have seen Abraham!”</p>
<p><sup>58&nbsp;</sup>“Very truly I tell you,” Jesus answered, “before Abraham was born, I am!”
<sup>59&nbsp;</sup>At this, they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping away from the temple grounds.</span></p>
